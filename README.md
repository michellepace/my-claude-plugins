# My Claude Plugins

Personal Claude Code marketplace: plugins and skills curated and packaged for individual install/uninstall control.

## Usage

Add this marketplace to your Claude Code:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add michellepace/my-claude-plugins
```

Then run the command `/plugin` to enable, disable, update, or uninstall a specific plugin in this marketplace. Now **restart** Claude Code for changes to take effect.

Enabled plugins will become available to ALL projects. They sometimes trigger automatically depending on your instruction, but I prefer to be explicit:

```text
Use the tailwindcss skill to style this component with dark mode support and responsive breakpoints.
```

## What's Included

Plugins and skills curated from other sources, repackaged into `my-claude-plugins` marketplace for modular control.

## About Plugins and Marketplaces

*Full layman's explanation in [this article](https://ailearnlog.com/claude-code-skills-plugins-marketplaces/).*

A marketplace is a collection of plugins. Each plugin is a "bag" containing any combination of skills, agents, commands, hooks, and MCP servers. Marketplaces consolidate components across all projects, provide source control, easy sharing and updates, and let you enable/disable entire plugins.

For this marketplace, the packaged plugins live in [plugins/](plugins/).

A plugin can contain any number of the following components:

```text
[plugin-name]/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json # Manifest (REQUIRED)
├── commands/ # slash commands .md
├── agents/ # new context window (.md)
├── skills/ # extends capabilities (.md)
├── hooks/ # reacts to events
├── scripts/ # eg. for hooks to run
└── .mcp.json # external tools to use
```

**WHY COLLECT OTHER PEOPLE'S SKILLS / PLUGINS IN MY OWN MARKETPLACE?**

You can't switch skills on and off, only plugins. I find selected skills that I want in marketplaces that are otherwise bloated with skills I will never need. I like to have only those skills I want, and so I package them into my own marketplace. Also, it means I can build on these plugins and have my own source control around it. The downside is that when the author publishes an update, I have to update the plugins manually in this marketplace.

Sometimes the plugin will contain exactly what I want, like this [Playwright skill](https://github.com/lackeyjb/playwright-skill). In this case, I just install it as another marketplace.
